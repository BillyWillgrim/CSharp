Variables and constants

Variable: a name given to a storage location in memory 
Constant: an immutable value

Declaring Variables/Constants

To declare a variable we start with a type, followed by an identifier

int number;

when declaring a variable we can optionally assign it a value

int Number = 1; // 

to declare a constant we start with the keyword const, and we have to initialise it

const float Pi = 3.14f;
