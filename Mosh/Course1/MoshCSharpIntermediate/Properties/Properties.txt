Here we will discuss how properties help us achieve encapsulation.

A property is a class member that encapsulates a getter and a setter for accessing a field.

They look like this: 

public class Person
{
	private DateTime _birthdate;

	public DateTime Birthdate
	{
		get { return _birthdate; }
		set { _birthdate = value; }
	}
}

But this can be simplified by using Auto-Implemented Properties

public class Person
{
	public DateTime Birthdate {get; set;} // internally, the compiler will create an private field
}
