Classes: 

Classes are the building blocks of an application. In the real world an application is made up of a collection of classes, each responisible for a particular behaviour in the app.

A class is essentially made up of two parts:
  
  Data - represented by fields
  Behaviour - represented by methods
  
An object is an instance of a class that resides in memory. A class defines the blueprint from which we can create objects at runtime.
  
We have two types of class members in C#:
  
  Instance members: accessible from an object
  
  Static members: accessible from the class
  
Why use static members? 

  To represent concepts that are singleton (there should only be one instance of it in memory)
  
  For example, the current date and time - DateTime.Now
  
  Another example, Console.WriteLine() - we only want one console in a console application
