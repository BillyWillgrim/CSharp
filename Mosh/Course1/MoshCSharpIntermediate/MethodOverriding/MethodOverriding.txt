Method Overriding

Method overriding is simply modifying the implementation of an inherited method.

There are often cases where we may want to modify the implementation of a method that we have inherited from a base class.
This may be because the implementation of the method in the base class does not apply to the inherited class.

Note: Method overriding and method overloading are not the same thing.

Overloading - method with same name but different signature.

Overriding - changing the implementation of an inherited method.

Example:

	public class Shape
	{
		public virtual void Draw()
		{
			// default implementation
		}
	}

	public class Circle : Shape
	{
		public override void Draw()
		{
			// new implementation
		}
	}

	public class Image : Shape
	{
		public override void Draw()
		{
		}
	}

Without the override keyword, the Draw method will use the default implementation defined in the base class.

This is an example of polymorphic behaviour in C#.
