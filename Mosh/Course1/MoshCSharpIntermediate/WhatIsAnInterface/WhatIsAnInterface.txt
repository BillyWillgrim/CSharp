What is an interface?

A language construct similar to a class (in syntax) but fundamentally different.

Syntax:

public interface ITaxCalculator
{
	int Calculate();
}

All interfaces start with an I.

Unlike classes, interfaces do not have implementation, only declaration.

Interface members do not have access modifiers.

Why use an interface?

Interfaces are used to build loosely coupled applications.
